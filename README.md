# Text Mining and Data Vizualization project

The main purposes of our analysis are: The construction of class clusters to compare them to the true categories that we have, through the two main Topic Modelling methods: LDA and NMF

Use one Neural Network model to classify the articles into different categories. In particular after trying several RNN models, we selected the two models (GRU and Lstm) whose prediction power and accuracy were better.

Use a Transformer based\Language Model model to classify the data. In particular we used BERT which bring us to obtain slightly better classification than before.
